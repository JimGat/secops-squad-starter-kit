## Active Decisions

### 2026-04-28T09:16:43-05:00: Team composition and role assignments

**By:** Sydnor (on behalf of the squad)

**What:** The secops-squad team is composed of 8 members from The Wire universe, each with distinct SecOps responsibilities:
- **McNulty** (Lead) — architecture, scope, code review
- **Kima** (SecOps Engineer) — Microsoft Security products, threat hunting, detection engineering
- **Freamon** (KQL Engineer) — KQL queries, Log Analytics, Azure Data Explorer
- **Herc** (Automation/SOAR) — Logic Apps, Azure Functions, SOAR workflows
- **Sydnor** (Platform Dev) — templates, CLI, framework, CI/CD
- **Carver** (Tester/QA) — validation, testing, quality gates
- **Scribe** (Session Logger) — logging, decisions, memory management
- **Ralph** (Work Monitor) — work tracking, circuit breaking

**Why:** Clear role separation ensures each domain has a dedicated specialist. SecOps work spans detection engineering, query authoring, automation, and platform tooling — each requires distinct expertise. Reviewer authority is shared between McNulty (architecture) and Carver (quality).
